# keyboard-2  
All the files and components used for this custom TKL keyboard.  
  
Layout is ISO (ISO-fr in my case).  
The plate can be changed to accomodate ANSI.  


Full keyboard:  
- skp file (made with sketchup 2019 pro)  

3D printed case:  
- STL file  
Printed in ABS with 100µm layers, 20% infill.  

Plate:  
- DXF file  
Laser cut with 0.15mm precision in stainless steel.  

Lid:  
- DXF file  
Laser cut with 0.15mm precision in stainless steel.  

Teensy/MOSFET/USB hub holder:  
- 2 x STL files (one for the holder, one for a locking piece)  
Printed in PLA with 100µm layers, 20% infill.  

Lists of components:  
- 87 x MX swiches  
- 91 x 3mm round LED  (87 for the switches, 1 inside the capslock keycap, 3 for the indicator lights)  
- 93 x 470Ohms resistors (87 for the switches LED, 2 for the encoder, 3 for the indicator LED, 1 for the base of the MOSFET)  
- 1 x 680Ohms resistor (for the emitter of the MOSFET)  
- 88 x 1N4148 diodes  (87 for the switches, 1 for the button on the encoder)  
- 1 x 6.25U stabilizer  
- 4 x 2U stabilizers  
- 1 x Encoder knob 16x14mm  
- 1 X 15mm Rotary Encoder EC11 (5 pins), screw on mount  
- 1 x Teensy 2.0++  
- 12 x M3 5mm ultra thin hex screws  
- 5 x M3 5mm hex screws  
- 17 x M3xD4.6mmxL3mm double twirl brass insert  
- 1 x Lemo FGG.0B.309.CLAD # Lemo FGG.0B.304.CLAD  
- 1 x Lemo HGG.0B.309.CLL # Lemo HGG.0B.304.CLL  
- 1 x USB cable with 3.1 male connector  
- 1 x MOSFET  
- 28 AWG wire  
- 1 x 3.1 female USB port (straight)  # only for USB version  
- 1 x 2.0 female USB port (straight) # only for USB version  
- 1 x 3-in-1 3.1 USB hub # only for USB version  
- 1 x set of felt pads (at least 4mm thick)  



Changes compared to the version I built:  
- the inner hole for the female connector has been enlarged by 1mm to allow the tightening of the nut  
- the 3 holes for the indicator LEDS have been enlarged by 0.2mm so that 3mm LED fit easily into them  
- the plate and lid should fit more easily (reduced all size by 0.15mm)
